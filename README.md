The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. 

In this app you will use node to:

1. View Products for Sale

2. View Low Inventory

3. Add to Inventory

4. Add New Product

5. If a manager selects `View Products for Sale`, the app will list every available item: the item IDs, names, prices, and quantities.

6. If a manager selects `View Low Inventory`, then the app will list all items with an inventory count lower than five.

7. If a manager selects `Add to Inventory`, the app will display a prompt that will let the manager "add more" of any item currently in the store.

8. If a manager selects `Add New Product`, it will allow the manager to add a completely new product to the store.

9. You will need a SQL database application to setup a conneciton on your local hosting machine. Once a connection and database are setup on your machine you will be able to run this application in node.

10. Don't forget to run the npm install for Inquirer & mysql

11. Enjoy!
